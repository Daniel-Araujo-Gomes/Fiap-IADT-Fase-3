{"title":"The Namesake","content":"Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: \"At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind.\" Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity. There's no  cleverness or showing-off inThe Namesake, just beautifully confident storytelling. Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy; it's simply that ordinary, hard-to-get-down-on-paper commodity: real life.--Claire Dederer--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Namesake'?","response":"Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli.

{"title":"The Naqib's Daughter","content":"Using impressive research, Egyptian author Serageldin (The Cairo House, 2003) posits a happier story for the actual Zeinab, daughter of Naqib Shaykh Bakri, who was briefly Napoleon&#x2019;s mistress during the French occupation of Egypt from 1798 to 1801, disavowed by her father despite his instigating her consorting with the French, and killed for her &#x201C;horizontal&#x201D; collaboration. Here 12-year-old Zeinab is given by her father to Napoleon in a Muslim marriage that is never consummated and later finds brief happiness in a marriage with chief engineer Nicolas Conte of the French Scientific Commission. Disavowed by her father, she is saved from being executed for treason by her pregnancy, then sheltered by the aristocratic philanthropist Sitt Nafisa the White. Serageldin recounts the devastation wrought on her home country by its successively more abusive occupiers&#x2014;the French, followed by the Turks and Albanians, who executed the leaders of the long-prominent Mamluke military caste&#x2014;in the context of the politics of the times. Through this plausible account of what Zeinab&#x2019;s life might have been, Serageldin opens a window on a tumultuous period in Egyptian history. --Michele Leber","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Naqib's Daughter'?","response":"Using impressive research, Egyptian author Serageldin (The Cairo House, 2003) posits a happier story for the actual Zeinab, daughter of Naqib Shaykh Bakri, who was briefly Napoleon&#x2019;s mistress during the French occupation of Egypt from 1798 to 1801, disavowed by her father despite his instigating her consorting with the French, and killed for her &#x201C;horizontal&#x201D; collaboration.

{"title":"Going Sane: Maps of Happiness","content":"In classic psychoanalytic style, Phillips strips our lives down to the fundamentals to illustrate the delicate balance between sanity and insanity. Sanity, he notes, \"has never been a popular word, or indeed... a condition one might write a book about.\" Madness, on the other hand, is dramatic and all too visible. We have psychiatrists, neurologists and researchers dedicated to studying and treating madness, but not even a quantifiable definition of saneness. Deftly guiding readers through historical and literary uses of \"sane\" and \"mad,\" Phillips, a British psychoanalyst (On Flirtation), cites Thomas Carlyle, R.D. Laing, Melanie Klein, D.W. Winnicott and Richard Dawkins, among others, to illustrate the stark absence of a definitive definition of sanity. InHamlet, for instance, Polonius uses the word \"madness\" to describe Hamlet's inventiveness and eloquent intelligence: he admires Hamlet's madness. Phillips examines the presence and essence of madness in all aspects of modern life in intriguing and disturbingly frank chapters on the chaos of raising children, the turmoil of adolescence, sexual appetites and the pursuit of wealth. His arguments, both thought provoking and provocative, may affect future definitions of sanity and madness, and readers are left with a fresh awareness of what it really means to be sane.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title":"Roy Rogers: King of the Cowboys","content":"Some things you just don't outgrow. Take Roy Rogers. Yes, the idea of singing cowboys is about as silly as fried Spam sandwiches, but if you were 10 once and watched Roy, Dale, and Trigger cavort on the big screen (or, later, on television), there's probably still a part of you that can't hear \"Happy Trails to You\" without feeling a wee bit wistful. You'll feel more than that after browsing through this nostalgia-soaked photo-biography. Combining wonderful vintage photographs with a brief autobiographical narrative from Roy himself, the book chronicles the storybook life of one Leonard Slye, a Depression-era teenager when his family left their Ohio farm for a dust-bowl journey to California. Only a few short years later, Leonard had become Roy Rogers, \"King of the Cowboys,\" and was launched on a career that would encompass 81 movies, a TV series, and hundreds of radio performances and recordings. The success of Roy Rogers says a lot about the U.S. during the Depression and throughout World War II, but it says even more about the wide eyes of kids everywhere at anytime. It's all here in this sparkling piece of Americana.Bill Ott","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Roy Rogers: King of the Cowboys'?","response":"Some things you just don't outgrow.

{"title":"The Yiddish Policemen's Union: A Novel (P.S.)","content":"[Signature]Reviewed byJess WalterThey are the \"frozen Chosen,\" two million people living, dying and kvetching in Sitka, Alaska, the temporary homeland established for displaced World War II Jews in Chabon's ambitious and entertaining new novel. It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title":"The Wise Woman","content":"The author of the Wideacre trilogy offers another intense, absorbing tale, a grisly drama of passion and witchcraft in 16th-century England. Growing up as an ill-used apprentice to Morach, the much-feared wise woman of the moors, Alys finds respite by joining an order of Catholic nuns. When young Lord Hugo and his men burn the abbey to the ground during a drunken rampage, Alys is the only one to escape; she flees back to Morach, consumed with guilt at having abandoned her dying sisters. Summoned to minister to Lord Hugh, Hugo's father, Alys soon finds herself deeply involved in the treachery and intrigue surrounding the old man's attempts to have his son's marriage to the barren Lady Catherine annulled. Attracted to Hugo despite his murderous past, Alys begins to practice witchcraft in earnest to rid him of Catherine and become his wife. Her spells work all too well: Catherine's long-awaited pregnancy ends disastrously, and Hugo comes to love Alys, but in a sickly haze of lust that provides no basis for marriage. Alys soon finds herself so sunk in evil, so removed from God's love, that only a truly shocking gesture can bring about her salvation. Gregory adeptly manipulates hair-raising horror and mounting suspense, brilliantly evoking the period's turbulent atmosphere.

{"title":"A Day in the Life of Canada","content":"Like the similar books about Australia, Hawaii, and Japan, each of these offers multiple photographic impressions recorded on a single day. Canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to Israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to Israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. The photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. A lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (June 8, 1984). The photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. Israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. With more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. The introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. And indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. The heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (May 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. Both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but Canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images.

{"title":"A Good Clean Fight","content":"A Good Clean Fightfocuses on the British campaign against Rommel in 1942, in particular on one light-armored company's deep reconnaissance of and raids on isolated German airfields--led by the rather daft Jack Lampard--and on Major Paul Schramm, a German intelligence officer, who cleverly tracks the company. We are also introduced to some air squadrons from both sides and their marvelous dogfights. In one tactile scene, a pilot rolls his craft and banks sharply to avoid flak; he \"browns out\" and then finds himself far over the desert, momentarily quite lost. Nonetheless, Schramm and Lampard steal the show, chasing each other, cracking jokes--they are really quite alike, and, seen through their eyes, war is a grim but also a joyous affair. Even the plague of flies that follows these sweating men every step of the way can seem amusing: \"If they followed Lampard rather more faithfully it was not because he was the officer but because he was six foot two and there was more of him to overheat.\" Robinson is extremely funny, actually, and subtle, which lifts his writing out of the genre; even so, he's not much interested in causes or in the meaninglessness of war. Of course it's meaningless, he might say. He wants to focus on young men in a great adventure, risking their lives and loving it, playing deadly games with complicated, deadly machinery. \"Men are always killing themselves to prove their manhood,\" says a woman at Paul Schramm's funeral.

{"title":"The Rhythm Section","content":"After the death of her parents and brother in a plane crash over the Atlantic, Stephanie Patrick descends into a life of prostitution and dissolution. She begins to pull herself together when a journalist tells her that the crash was no accident, that it was a terrorist bombing covered up by the world's intelligence agencies. Then the journalist is murdered, and Stephanie is recruited into a shadowy law enforcement agency to become a killer. If the plot of this first novel sounds a little like the movie and TV seriesLa Femme Nikita, that's understandable. But Burnell manages to inject some new life into the tired premise. Stephanie is a tough, resilient heroine, seriously challenged by the multiple personalities she's forced to don, while focused laserlike on avenging her family's death. Even the terrorists emerge as more than cardboard cutouts, especially in the climactic scene in which Stephanie confronts her antagonist.

He was born in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to British diplomatic parents who were friends of Emperor Haile Selassie. Thesiger remembers Addis Ababa, the capital, as a village with grass huts, no roads and colorful ceremonies. He attended Eton and Oxford, then returned to Africa for the first of many journeys, exploring the Awash River (home to the dreaded Danakil, whose warriors killed randomly to prove their manhood and collected their victims' genitals for trophies). As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert. In addition to superb adventure, Thesiger gives a fine portrait of the waning days of the British Empire in the Sudan and of the last revolution in Ethiopia.

{"title":"Witch: A Magikal Journey- A Hip Guide to Modern Witchcraft","content":"Describing itself as \"A Hip Guide to Modern Witchcraft,\" this uninhibited offering from Australian witch, rock diva, model and media personality Horne is pure pop entertainment, reading more like a feature in a fashion magazine than an account of the present-day practice of Wicca. Steeped in girlfriend-to-girlfriend attitude and style, Horne's funky and relentlessly positive prose (\"[Eve] was, in fact, a benevolent and switched-on sister....\") is liable to infuriate practiced occultists while proving irresistible to young people fascinated by or even just curious about witchcraft. Part memoir and part manual, the book offers snapshots of just about every part of a modern witch's practice, from casting spells and observing Wiccan sabbaths to setting up an altar and practicing \"skyclad\" (or nude)Anot to mention how to make magic with, for and during sex. Although this guidebook can safely be characterized as a lighthearted romp through the practice of witchcraft, it does contain some useful and well-organized reference material, such as a glossary of \"magickal\" herbs, a calendar of the witch's year and a full complement of easy-to-follow spells for love, money and so forth. Occasionally, ethical qualms silence Horne's ready tongue, leading to curiously unusable directives (as in \"Bitchcraft,\" the chapter on hexing, where she describes in graphic detail the preparation and abuse of an enemy's effigy, but primly refuses to tell you what to say while you're doing it). Experienced Wiccans and occultists will want to turn to more authoritative sources, but as it stands, this is an appealing introduction for the dabbler, the dreamer and other wide-eyed seekers of modern-day magic. (Jan.) Forecast: From the sexy photo of Horne on its jacket to its overall pop approach and its unusually low price (especially for a hardcover containing color photos), this title promises to be the witchcraft book of 2001. Thorsons is backing it with a three-city author tour and a 60,000 print run. Expect the book to cast a spell on readers, resulting in charmed sales.Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Witch: A Magikal Journey- A Hip Guide to Modern Witchcraft'?","response":"Describing itself as \"A Hip Guide to Modern Witchcraft,\" this uninhibited offering from Australian witch, rock diva, model and media personality Horne is pure pop entertainment, reading more like a feature in a fashion magazine than an account of the present-day practice of Wicca.

{"title":"The Rescue Party (Tales From Percy's Park)","content":"PreSchool-Grade 1-Special, sweet, and funny, this book will delight young children. Percy the park keeper spends his day off relaxing with his animal friends. The first illustration depicts the man lounging against an old tree trunk, chewing on a long stem of grass; his anthropomorphized friends recline in identical positions. Everything is fine until a jumping game gets out of hand and a young rabbit falls into an abandoned well. Percy rushes to help, throwing her a long rope and instructing her to tie it tight. Not understanding what she is supposed to do, she ties it to the log she's sitting on and proceeds to find her own way out. The man and his helpers strain and pull until finally out pops the log-but no bunny. The following page folds out and out again, revealing a long line of befuddled animals-and a little rabbit holding onto the end. This fold-out page is clever but will not hold up well in a library.

{"title":"To Ride Hell's Chasm","content":"In this splendid fantasy about two warriors, a princess, and a demonic plot, the last is against Princess Anja of Sessalie, whom Commander Taskin thinks has been kidnapped. Captain Mykkael thinks there is more to it than that, but because of his race and mercenary background, he isn't readily believed until civil war threatens to break out in Sessalie. Meanwhile, Princess Anja has fled far away, and Mykkael has to flee for his own life, overtake her, enlist help for her, and finally lead her to safety through the monster-haunted terrain of Hell's Chasm. Once a marriage is arranged into a family of potent sorcerers, Anja can see about saving her realm and family, while Mykkael takes vengeance on the demons who, many years ago, drove him from his homeland and love. Wurts is skillful as ever at world-building and pacing, and her background as an artist shows in the kind of intensely visual writing that makes one wish more fantasy were written by artists.Roland GreenCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title":"The Butterfly Lion","content":"Grade 4-8.  Elements of fantasy and fiction are woven into this fast-paced adventure. A student runs away from boarding school and meets an elderly lady, whom he later discovers is a ghost. She tells the story of another boy, Bertie, who grew up long ago in Africa and eventually became her husband. Lonely and neglected by his parents, he rescues an abandoned white lion cub and cares for it, gradually forming a close bond. After some years the boy's parents abruptly decide to send him to school in England and sell the lion. Bertie attempts to save the animal by returning it to the jungle, but it has lost its ability to survive in the wild and returns to the only home it has known. A French circus owner buys the lion, and the boy vows never to forget him. Twelve years later, Bertie fights in World War I and is decorated for rescuing wounded comrades. In a small French town he finally finds his lion, starving and near death, and the two friends are reunited. Heartened by the woman's tale, the student returns to school. This touching story is well written and emotionally satisfying. Readers will be drawn to this fascinating tale of a unique friendship between boy and beast.

{"title":"The Book of Revelation","content":"American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher, and writer, Clarence Larkin was born October 28, 1850, in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, \"\"Prophetic Truth,\"\" for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.\"--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Book of Revelation'?","response":"American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher, and writer, Clarence Larkin was born October 28, 1850, in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

{"title":"The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde: The First Uncensored Transcript of The Trial of Oscar Wilde vs. John Douglas (Marquess of Queensberry), 1895","content":"In 1895, Oscar Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor for \"committing acts of gross indecency with other male persons.\" Wilde's story became a cautionary tale for homosexuals in Victorian England; in the century since, he has come to be celebrated as a martyr of the gay struggle for recognition. This volume, with an introduction and commentary by Wilde's grandson, Holland, publishes for the first time the unabridged transcript of the first of the three infamous trials that resulted in Wilde's destruction. The irony, as Holland's introduction makes abundantly clear, is that Wilde courted his imprisonment, suing his inamorata's father, the Marquess Queensberry, John Douglass, for libel when Queensberry left a card for him at the Albemarle Club that read, \"For Oscar Wilde, posing sodomite.\" Wilde might have been best served by tearing up the card and forgetting it; instead, he pressed charges. But Wilde's riskiest step was treating the witness stand as a theatrical stage. When a prosecutor asked him if he had kissed a certain young man, Wilde joked, \"Oh no, never in my life. He was a peculiarly plain boy.\" With that one flippant comment, Holland's text suggests, the die was cast. But the transcript and Holland's judicious notes also reveal how ill-served Wilde was by his counsel. Some of the same letters that were later used to convict Wilde were introduced by his own lawyers in this first trial as evidence. The general reader might find a work that condenses all three trial transcripts into one narrative, such as Moises Kaufman's stage adaptation, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, more accessible, but this volume is invaluable for the Wilde enthusiast, the legal scholar, the champion of human rights and the student of English literature.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde: The First Uncensored Transcript of The Trial of Oscar Wilde vs. John Douglas (Marquess of Queensberry), 1895'?","response":"In 1895, Oscar Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor for \"committing acts of gross indecency with other male persons.\" Wilde's story became a cautionary tale for homosexuals in Victorian England; in the century since, he has come to be celebrated as a martyr of the gay struggle for recognition.

{"title":"Among the Mountains: Travels Through Asia","content":"Thesiger has been called the last of the great British \"gentlemen explorers.\" Born in 1910 and educated at Eton and Oxford, he has been praised for his books on the Arab world (Arabian Sands, The Marsh Arabs) and on East and North Africa. This account presents edited portions of journal entries written during trips to remote mountain areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kurdistan between 1952 and 1965, as well as numerous black-and-white photographs that he took at the time. Some of these areas are more developed today than they were half a century ago, while others are even more inaccessible owing to political upheavals. Thesiger's writing is sparse, as would be expected from diary entries, and consequently may disappoint those looking for more detail or seeking current travel information.

{"title":"The Hungry Tide","content":"Starred Review.One of the great delights of reading a novel by the likes of Ghosh or Salman Rushdie is imagining their dialogue emerging in the mellifluous tones of the Indian-accented English spoken by their characters. In this audiobook, narrator Bamji accomplishes that task with skill, credibly rendering the lilting flavor of subcontinental English and reveling in the musicality of Ghosh's tale, set in a remote sector of India. Bamji invests most of his resources into the rich, ringing cadences of Kanai, the translator and intellectual at the heart of the book. Kanai, a striver looking to pull himself up by his bootstraps, possesses a certain comic charm, and Bamji embraces the role with panache. He also alternates smoothly between Kanai's dulcet tones and the flatness of Indian-American scientist Piyali, who encounters Kanai by chance when traveling to investigate Indian marine life. Ghosh's book evocatively imagines an India poised between past and present, and Bamji brings out the enormous range of voices clamoring for attention in this unfamiliar setting.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Paddington is, understandably, a favorite character for kids, one they can truly relate to, as his best-laid, well-intentioned plans somehow go topsy-turvy.

In the first book in the series, Curse of the Mistwraith  (1993), the half-brothers dark Arithon s'Ffalenn and blond  Lysaer s'Ilessid were set against each other by the eponymous  enemy, and now, 30-some years later, they're still going after  each other. This book's action begins in mid-flight during a  winter gale, with Arithon fleeing the walled city Jaelot, where  he's been imprisoned. With him he drags the unwilling peasant  Fionn Areth Caid'an, magically raised as his double to trap him.  Soon they join forces with Dakar the Mad Prophet (whose  prophecies have an erratic track record, though some have been  important), assigned by the Fellowship of Sorcerers to defend  our protagonist. Dakar has supplies and horses ready. Much  geography is traversed with many turgid pages spent attempting  to describe the indescribable effects of magic. Occasionally the  focus moves to Lysaer, with his large retinue of soldiers and  fanatic priests, who in private practice rituals as sorcerous as  the techniques of which they accuse Arithon. While fans have  compared this series to Robert Jordan's extended Wheel of Time  series, newcomers may be put off by the stilted language (\"The  guard captain's baleful stillness held threat\") and the mishmash  of plot.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Peril's Gate: Third Book of The Alliance of Light (The Wars of Light and Shadow, Book 6) (The Wars of Light and Shadow series)'?","response":"The latest installment in the Wars of Light and Shadow series,  also the third movement of an inner story arc called the  Alliance of Light, well represents the vast and tangled plot  lines readers have come to expect from this prolific and popular  author.

{"title":"The Secret Path (Tales From Percy's Park)","content":"PreSchool-Grade 2?Percy the park keeper is back, and this time he plans to spend the day tidying up the maze. Taking a ball of string to leave as a trail, he sets off with his squirrel friend, unaware that his other animal pals plan to surprise him by getting to the center first. Percy takes so long to complete his tasks, however, that the creatures fall asleep on a lion-shaped bench, and Percy plays a trick on them instead. It turns out that the joke is on all of them, though?the well-meaning squirrel has collected all the string, and they will have a difficult time finding their way out. The poem that preceeds the story foreshadows such a dilemma, and at the conclusion, readers are invited to help by choosing the right path on the large, fold-out maze attached to the back of the book. (It will be disappointing, of course, if previous readers have navigated their way out with crayon or pencil.) Butterworth's bright, watercolor cartoons depict mischievous, fun-loving animals set for a springtime caper. While this pleasant tale of friendship doesn't contain the drama of Percy's previous adventures, his fans will enjoy it.

Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind remains the blueprint for the genre, while Tolstoy's War and Peace carries off the literary honours ... it's quickly apparent that the Russian-born author Paullina Simons has the measure of this kind of epic romantic saga. The power of her descriptive writing, the vividness of the historical detail and, most of all, the strength of her central characters mark out her novel as a considerable achievement ... she is able to make some powerful statements about the durability of the human spirit, but never at the expense of descriptive passages refulgent with power and beauty' Barry Forshaw, amazon"}

{"title":"Lady of Hay","content":"Erskine's first novel gets off to a fine start. As a participant in a college research project on hypnotic regression, Jo Clifford is almost too good a subject. Under hypnosis, she relives the final, tortured moments in the life of Matilda, a 12th century Welshwoman. In the process, Jo herself comes close to death. The story then jumps 15 years. Jo, now a journalist researching regression, is again hypnotized and again regresses to Matilda's excitement-packed life. Unfortunately, the pace of the early pages is not maintained. The problem is not with Jo\/Matilda, who are both well-drawn, or even with the whopping coincidences Jo encounters. What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters, Jo's acquaintances. They talk to her and about her, they try to help her and they conspire against her, all at the expense of the central plotline. This is still a good read, but it could have been better.

{"title":"Miss Garnet's Angel","content":"Guardian angels have attained such trendy status in American popular fiction that it's refreshing to read Vickers, a writer from across the Atlantic, whose subtle depiction of a life touched by a heavenly spirit carries not a hint of clich&#x82;. Her debut novel is an unpretentious gem of a book that charts the late coming-of-age of Miss Julia Garnet, a retired English schoolteacher who spends six months in Venice after her lifelong companion, Harriet, dies. Venice has a magical effect on reserved Julia: a dyed-in-the-wool Communist, she relaxes in her antipathy toward religion, and even begins to visit the local church. There, she becomes enamored of a series of paintings that tell the story of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, a tale that mixes elements of Judaism with the religion of Zoroaster. In the story, young Tobias travels to Medea, part of the Persian Empire, to collect a debt for his father, blind Tobit. He is accompanied on his journey by a hired guide who turns out to be the Angel Raphael. As Julia learns more about Tobias's trek, she embarks upon a soul-altering journey of her own. She falls in love with an art dealer, Carlo, and befriends Sarah and Toby, twins working on the restoration of a Venetian chapel. When Toby disappears suddenly, after discovering a priceless Renaissance painting, Julia finds out that neither Carlo nor the twins are exactly what they seem--but that the Angel Raphael's watchful spirit will help good prevail. (Feb.)Forecast: This touching novel, a sleeper hit in Britain, should win American fans eager for a treatment of religious themes without the gooey sentiment that often accompanies the topic of angels.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Miss Garnet's Angel'?","response":"Guardian angels have attained such trendy status in American popular fiction that it's refreshing to read Vickers, a writer from across the Atlantic, whose subtle depiction of a life touched by a heavenly spirit carries not a hint of clich&#x82;.

{"title":"Blood Royal: The Story of the Spencers and the Royals","content":"This is a lively if superficial overview of the lives and times of Princess Diana's illustrious family through 500 years, from the Tudor age to the present. Gaining and losing vast fortunes; making shrewd, status-enhancing marriages; and jockeying for social and political power are the recurring themes of this family saga, whose subjects rose from being wealthy farmers during the reign of Henry VII to ranking among the most prosperous and prominent families in the land by the 18th century, only to see both their wealth and their status decline throughout the Victorian and contemporary eras--until Diana, third daughter of the eighth earl, made her \"fairy-tale\" marriage into the royal family. Including such notables as Sarah Churchill and the infamous 18th-century duchess of Marlborough, whose carefully calculated scheming made the family one of the richest in the land, the Spencer clan is replete with colorful characters. That Princess Diana herself drew strength from this ancestral heritage, as Pearson claims, is undoubtable; more dubious, however, are his repeated assertions that various facets of Diana's own character are direct inheritances from one ancestor or another. This suggestion that biology is destiny culminates in the proposition--based on the observation that Princes William and Harry look more like their mother than their father--that the Spencer genes have superseded those of the Windsors and will be instrumental in shaping the future of the British monarchy. While this claim that the Spencer family history yields vital insights into the destinies of Diana and her children seems somewhat overstated, those who admire the late princess of Wales and those who are drawn to accounts of English dynastic history will find the story of the Spencers engrossing.

{"title":"Toro! Toro!","content":"Grade 5-8-A grandfather tells his grandson about the horrors of war in this story set during the Spanish Civil War. As a youngster, Antonito lived on a small farm outside the village of Sauceda. His father raised strong black bulls for the bullring, or corrida. The boy bonded with a newborn calf after its mother died, and in order to save it, he led Paco into the surrounding hills. While they were away, Franco's soldiers bombed the village. Leaving Paco behind, Antonito returned home, discovering the farm in flames. He escaped back into the safety of the countryside, but couldn't find the calf. Weeks later, suffering from hunger and exhaustion, he was found by his Uncle Juan, a Republican soldier, and nursed back to health. While recuperating, he heard a tale of a large black bull that chased down Nationalist soldiers, and he hoped that it was Paco. Years later, after he dreamed that the creature rested next to him while he slept in the forest, he awakened to discover hoof marks of a massive bull in the still-warm grass. Morpurgo's action-filled novel packs an emotional punch. The author gradually reveals the historical information and narrates the tale with the careful detachment of someone relating a story so awful that he can hardly bear to tell it. Ideal for reluctant readers, this book focuses on the loss and grief that grows out of times of war.Shawn Brommer, South Central Library System, Madison, WICopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title":"Seven Days to a Magickal New You","content":"For the novice witch, the New Ager or the merely experimental, Horne (Witch: A Magical Journey) conjures up a charming seven-day guide to creating \"an enchanted sense of self.\" Don't expect bubbling cauldrons and powdered bat wings: directions and inspirations (printed in purple, the color of \"wisdom and insight\") encourage readers to embrace their inner Wiccan by burning special incense, bathing in particular essential oils, reciting different affirmations and focusing on transforming themselves into \"potent and powerful being[s].\" In other words, Horne offers tips on a kind of practical magic, which focuses on the self rather than the spell. Her instructions are practical, too: if mace, cedar and nutmeg are hard to come by, burn lavender incense; if chanting \"skyclad\" (read: naked) doesn't appeal, wear a white flowing robe. This simplicity and pragmatism is especially important in light of Horne's personal theology, which with its elements of Hinduism, Greek mythology, astrology, Native American ritual and Hazelden self-help books is extremely ecumenical. Readers eager to explore the latest developments in self-improvement trends might find helpful mantras within and will likely be delighted by Horne's enthusiasm for her subject. It would take some real magic to convince the skeptics, however; but if anyone can do that, it's this mediagenic author.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Seven Days to a Magickal New You'?","response":"For the novice witch, the New Ager or the merely experimental, Horne (Witch: A Magical Journey) conjures up a charming seven-day guide to creating \"an enchanted sense of self.\" Don't expect bubbling cauldrons and powdered bat wings: directions and inspirations (printed in purple, the color of \"wisdom and insight\") encourage readers to embrace their inner Wiccan by burning special incense, bathing in particular essential oils, reciting different affirmations and focusing on transforming themselves into \"potent and powerful being[s].\" In other words, Horne offers tips on a kind of practical magic, which focuses on the self rather than the spell.

{"title":"The Ghosts of Sleath","content":"Veteran horror writer James Herbert brings back the protagonist ofHauntedto  investigate psychic disturbances in a picturesque village in the Lake District of England. It's an interesting mishmash of a novel--not entirely successful, but enjoyable all the same. Herbert's penchant for gorgeously visceral carnage unfortunately clashes with his equally skilled ability to create a subtle mood of supernatural terror. And he throws way too many ingredients into the stew: family secrets, rape, infanticide, necrophilia, the &quot;Black Arts,&quot; a moldering mansion, a sinister yellow fog, drowning children, poltergeist pranks, a haunted painting, a tormented vicar, a neglectful doctor, even an evil knight. Yet, asNecrofile: The Review of Horror Fictionreports, &quot;None of these  flaws are fatal. These days, making a classic ghost story work at  all--let alone on the scale ofThe  Ghosts of Sleath--requires a daunting level of craft, control, and consistency....

As such, Southwest can be read as a gastronomic travel book, filled with escapist textures and tastes. The book is organized by locale (e.g., the Rio Grande Basin gets one chapter) and by genre (desserts and beverages; soups, stews and chilis). It's both picturesque and practical: Kolpas sets the scene well for upscale-indigenous meals with his surveys of Southwest history and habits, while Fenzl offers practical and appealing recipes (especially for salsas and the like, and for appetizers).

{"title":"Zelda's Cut","content":"Masquerading as a trashy novelist may solve English writer Isobel Latimer's financial problems, but it also plunges her into a full-fledged identity crisis in Gregory's flighty, overplotted novel. Isobel needs money to support her ailing husband, Philip, and his newfound interest in pool building, so when her agent, Troy Cartwright, informs her that her literary novels are earning less and less, she tells him, \"If they won't pay me to write good books, then I'll just have to write bad.\" She and Troy invent the persona of Zelda Vere, a heavily made-up, well-dressed blonde bombshell, the opposite of 52-year-old country matron Isobel. Zelda's \"survivor fiction,\" The Devil's Disciple, is a major hit that earns Isobel all the money she could ever need, but she finds herself increasingly caught between superego and id, between an unfulfilling loyal marriage and sexual experimentation with Troy. When Isobel sets off on her book tour with Troy, Gregory's plot takes an exotic and erotic turn, depicting a world of cross-dressing, cocaine and champagne. Returning to her home in Kent, Isobel finds Philip miraculously recovered and expending all his energy on the construction of an expensive new pool. Philip has also decided to invest (with Isobel's money) in the handsome pool man's business. Backstabbers reveal themselves, to no one's surprise, and Isobel's deliberationsAshould she stay or should she go?Aare prolonged until an abrupt, bewildering denouement puts a stop to the runaway narrative.

{"title":"The Solace of Leaving Early","content":"A romance evolves in the wake of a domestic shooting in Kimmel's intelligent and compassionate debut novel, which brings two friends of one of the victims together in a small Indiana town. Amos Townsend is the male protagonist, a 40-ish preacher who counseled the late Alice Baker-Maloney as her frayed marriage degenerated into a fatal confrontation with her controlling husband, Jack. Amos remains tormented by his attraction to Alice and his inability to have prevented the tragedy. Meanwhile, bookish Langston Braverman has returned home after dropping out of her Ph.D. program following an affair with an academic colleague and subsequent nervous breakdown. The two clash after Langston's mother, AnnaLee, orders her to abandon her literary projects to care for Alice's two orphaned daughters; Amos accuses Langston of being unfit for the job when both girls continue to exhibit a bizarre variety of compulsive, religiously oriented behaviors. The girls' crisis continues to escalate, leading to a series of melodramatic scenes in which Amos and Langston are forced to confront their own demons. There are some winning moments as the protagonists move toward a romance, although things are hindered somewhat by the sluggish pace in the early going, as Kimmel (A Girl Named Zippy) meanders through scenes detailing smalltown Midwestern life and as she delves into the pasts of the two leads. Still, she proves a wise, compassionate and often very witty storyteller whose affection for her characters is contagious.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Solace of Leaving Early'?","response":"A romance evolves in the wake of a domestic shooting in Kimmel's intelligent and compassionate debut novel, which brings two friends of one of the victims together in a small Indiana town.

{"title":"William Pitt the Younger: A Biography","content":"Late-eighteenth-century politician William Pitt the Younger was the youngest (at 24) and longest-serving British prime minister. Beyond those facts, historical opinion varies--some scholars regard him as a reformer, and others as a reactionary, a debate that inspirits Michael Turner'sPittthe Younger (2003). Hague's biography differs from Turner's by muting interpretive issues and amplifying the day-to-day events in a life permeated by politics. Pitt's personal life remains enigmatic, and Hague acknowledges Pitt's elusiveness even as he attempts to ascertain whether he was an alcoholic or a homosexual. More certain is Pitt's ability as a leader and orator of the House of Commons, an institution the author himself knows well; he was the Conservative Party's former debating antagonist of Labour leader Tony Blair. Hague's experience adds convincing power to his account of Pitt's career, explaining how he remained ascendant for so long.

It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title":"Spirit of the Child","content":"Reviews of the first edition 'This book has rapidly become a classic of children's spirituality. It provides an empirical and a conceptual basis for the idea of relational spirituality, an understanding that is not only of great practical interest to teachers, clergy and parents, but creates the groundwork for a prophetic protest against forces in the modern world that would undermine the natural spirituality of human beings. It is not only refreshingly clear in an area often somewhat confused, but offers original insights into the lives and attitudes of young children.' - John M Hull is Professor of Practical Theology in the Queen's Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education in Birmingham and Emeritus Professor of Religious Education at the University of Birmingham, England. 'The Spirit of the Child...is currently the seminal book on children's spirituality on the international scene.' - Christian Education Journal 'Very, very impressive.' - Professor Andrew Greeley, University of Chicago [One of best known sociologists of religion in the world, with a US nationally syndicated newspaper column on religion.] 'For many people, this was a ground-breaking research study...many, perhaps most, subsequent research studies made use of their definitions of spirituality and the broad perspective of spirituality that encompasses all children everywhere.' - Professor Don Ratcliff, Toccoa Falls College 'David Hay and Rebecca Nye have done outstanding research in this difficult, yet most important area. Almost all children are born with a spiritual potential, but how are we to recognize its specificity in a given case and how to foster its development - rather than to let it wither away or even corrupt it unwittingly? Reading this volume will help all involved to understand these issues more deeply, and to contribute more to the blossoming of a child's spirituality.' - Professor K.

{"title":"The Highly Sensitive Child: Helping Our Children Thrive When the World Overwhelms Them","content":"As a highly sensitive person (HSP) herself and a psychotherapist, Aron is in a strong position to provide guidance to parents who are raising highly sensitive children (HSCs), and provides here a wealth of useful suggestions and case studies. The author, who has studied and written about what she calls \"high sensitivity\" (The Highly Sensitive Person), states that this is a personality trait that occurs in 15% to 20% of the population. Although HSCs tend to be \"empathetic, smart, intuitive, careful and conscientious,\" they are also easily overstimulated and require informed parenting in order to prevent temper tantrums, stress illnesses and the avoidance of pleasurable group activities. Aron offers helpful advice that will assist both nonsensitive and highly sensitive parents through all stages of their child's development from infancy to adolescence. For example, since HSCs have great difficulty with change, it is necessary to prepare them gently so that they do not feel powerless during transitions. According to the author, there are four basic strategies that will help an HSC to become a happy adult: parents should foster their child's self-esteem, try to reduce the feelings of shame HSCs may develop because they are different, employ only mild positive discipline and learn how to talk positively to teachers and friends about their HSC so that interactions will be productive.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Highly Sensitive Child: Helping Our Children Thrive When the World Overwhelms Them'?","response":"As a highly sensitive person (HSP) herself and a psychotherapist, Aron is in a strong position to provide guidance to parents who are raising highly sensitive children (HSCs), and provides here a wealth of useful suggestions and case studies.

{"title":"Folly","content":"\"The thing about madness was, it just took so damn much energy, and it  was so thoroughly tedious in the meantime.\"  Master woodworker Rae Newborn knows madness intimately, with every bone, every pore, every particle of her being. At 52, with three suicide attempts, extended hospitalizations, the death of her husband and daughter, and a vicious attack behind her, Rae has come to Folly Island, far out in the Straits of Juan de Fuca, to rebuild her life by building a house:She would pull herself together, she would go and rebuild Desmond's house, she would lift his walls and dwell within them quietly all the rest of her days.  Everything that House was lay there waiting for her to take it up: House as shelter, House as permanence, House as a continuation and a legacy, comfort and challenge, safety and beauty, symbol and reality joined as one.Bequeathed to Rae by Desmond Newborn, a great-uncle she never met, Folly Island is lovely indeed.  But when Rae discovers Desmond's journal in the 70-year-old ruins of his house, she learns that Desmond had his own internal horrors to confront on the island.  As she labors in solitude, her prickly nature deterring all but the most determined of her would-be neighbors, it's not just her well-being that's at stake.  Rae must prove herself sane if she is to have any contact with her beloved granddaughter Petra. So when the \"skin-crawling feeling of being watched\" doesn't fade, she does her best to ignore it. But does paranoia have its roots in reality? And is Rae doomed to repeat her ancestor's tragic end?So effectively does King weave together past and present--the shrouded history of Desmond's life and death on Folly, and the tense, dusty, exhilaratingly panicky account of Rae's wrestling with old demons and new timber--that the future seems less important than the author might have wished.  In other words, the eventual unmasking of Rae's watcher pales in comparison to the gradual revelation of Rae herself within King's haunted and haunting narrative. But with such a strong character and such moodily lovely prose, readers shouldn't miss the denouement-driven trappings of standard suspense.--Kelly Flynn--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Folly'?","response":"\"The thing about madness was, it just took so damn much energy, and it  was so thoroughly tedious in the meantime.\"  Master woodworker Rae Newborn knows madness intimately, with every bone, every pore, every particle of her being.

{"title":"Evil Under the Sun (Poirot)","content":"Considered by many to be one of the very best Agatha Christie mysteries, this macabre tale has lost none of its crisp intrigue since it was first published in 1940. Using a plot formula that has since become a mystery standard, Christie conveniently gathers all the characters in one hard-to-leave location, in this case, the Jolly Roger, a vacation hotel on the southern coast of England. One of the guests, a gorgeous, dramatic flirt, is strangled to death, and the famous detective Hercule Poirot who happens to be vacationing at the Jolly Roger, too sets out to solve the case. Each of the well-developed characters is suspect, and listeners will constantly be changing their bets as to whodunit. British stage actor Suchet, who many know as the definitive Poirot from the Public Television Mystery! series was an obvious choice for the reader of this production, having won an Audie award for reading Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1997.

{"title":"Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic","content":"Kosko , an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, makes a provocative new scientific paradigm intelligible to the general reader. Fuzzy logic posits a world in which absolutes, such as those implied in the words \"true\" and \"false , \" are less important and interesting than the matters of degree between them. \"Fuzziness is grayness,\" and \"the truth lies in the middle,\" according to Kosko, one of the pioneers of fuzzy logic theory, which he persuasively presents as a world view rooted more in Buddhist and Taoist assumptions than in the dichotomous Aristotelian tradition. He proposes FATs (Fuzzy Approximation Theorems) for the existence (and non-existence, as fuzziness demands) of God and as models of the abortion debate. In consumer terms, fuzzy logic is behind such \"smart\" machines as air conditioners and microwave ovens that gauge their operation to the conditions and demands of a given moment's task.

{"title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Golf Book: Lessons and Teachings from a Lifetime in Golf","content":"Before titanium drivers, before oversized heads and bubble shafts, before electronic systems to tell you how far you are from the pin, golf was much the same game it is today. The lessons Harvey Penick taught in the pre-gadget days  still stand. The golf swing is basically the same, and Penick could teach it better than anybody. For most of his life, he never intended to publish hisLittle Red Book, a notebook of golf wisdom and anecdotes that he  compiled with the idea that he'd pass it on to his son. But, for the sake of history, it's a good thing that he changed his mind. Contained in its 175 pages is just about all you need to know about golf from a technical standpoint, along with Penick's priceless memories of working with famous pros, teaching absolute nobodies to get the ball in the air, and finding a horde of bat guano and hauling it across town in a pickup truck to fertilize his golf course. This book makes you feel good about playing golf, that you're part of something steeped in ritual and mystery and tradition, and that the game was played perfectly well before perimeter-weighted, graphite-shafted irons came along.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Harvey Penick's Little Red Golf Book: Lessons and Teachings from a Lifetime in Golf'?","response":"Before titanium drivers, before oversized heads and bubble shafts, before electronic systems to tell you how far you are from the pin, golf was much the same game it is today.

{"title":"Rough Justice","content":"During the biggest snowstorm in the history of Philadelphia, the jury is out. The defense is confident of a verdict of not guilty, but then client Elliot Steere admits to his council that he is a murderer. Marta Richter does not take this revelation happily. In fact, she's so outraged that she wants her client's secret revealed no matter what it does to her career. Steere isn't about to let her blow his chances, and with powerful connections, money, and muscle, he works from his jail cell to silence Marta and her colleagues before the sequestered jury makes a decision. If readers like soap opera?type cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, a plot that reads like a TV script, and a little gory violence here and there, they will like this book. The characters are well thought out, but most often sequences of the story unfold implausibly, as when Marta hunts for clues in her client's house and boat. Attorney Bennie Rosato, the feisty character from a previous Scottoline novel (Legal Tender, LJ 7\/96), makes an appearance here but is not very involved in the plot except for a \"save-the-day\" routine in the last few chapters. This is essential for readers already hooked on Scottoline, but don't start with this one when introducing her to readers.-?Shirley Gibson Coleman, Ann Arbor Dist.

Still mourning the death of her lover, Richard, Kate is hired by two \"barely comprehensible Glaswegian musicians\" to find out who is trashing their band's reputation by sending goons to break up their shows. She hasn't time to troll Manchester's music scene before friends complicate things by dropping bombshells. First, her business partner announces he's selling his share of the shop and moving to Australia; unfortunately, Kate lacks the funds to buy him out. Then her best friend, Alexis, says that she and her pregnant lover, Christine, need help. The gynecologist who, as Alexis puts it, \"worked with us\" on the pregnancy has been murdered, and Alexis believes that if Kate doesn't steal the relevant medical files they'll lose the baby. And that's if Kate can figure out who the doctor is: Alexis knows her as Helen Maitland, but the newspapers call her Sarah Blackstone. By the time Kate figures out who stabbed the mysterious doctor, she has forgotten why she's looking. But as Kate cruises along, whether setting up a trap with her chum DCI Della Prentice or cutting a deal with the \"Godfather of Manchester\" (who has a fake Italian accent), readers will happily keep up, even if it leaves them a little breathless.

Both are celebrated inProvence the Beautiful Cookbook, an oversized (more than two feet tall!) picture and cookbook of breathtaking color photos and authentic regional recipes. The 270 recipes, compiled and written by award-winning food book authorRichard Olney, include soups and starters; seafood, meat, game, and poultry dishes; vegetable and grain specialties; and simple but luscious desserts. Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift.Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven&#xE7;al regions with recipes arranged by courses. There are exemplary versions of bouillabaisse and bourride (the creamy, garlic-infused fish chowder), estouffade (braised beef, here with olives and mushrooms), daubs (stews), vegetable-filled omelets, and tians (savory gratins). Less familiar treasures include a mixed herb pasta from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, porgy with crab sauce from the Var, a braised stuffed lamb shoulder from Vaucluse, zucchini and rice gratin from the Alpes Maritimes, and dried figs in thyme and red wine syrup, also from the Var. The recipes reflect Olney's unerring palate and dedication to tradition; some cooks may find certain dishes beyond their reach, but all will discover approachable recipes that are easily made.

{"title":"Evening in the Palace of Reason","content":"In his lively history,Evening in the Palace of Reason, James R. Gaines sets two remarkable--and remarkably different--historical figures on a collision course toward a single night in Potsdam in 1747: the composer Johann Sebastian Bach--\"old Bach,\" as he was called then at the age of 62--and the still-young Prussian king, Frederick II, already known as Frederick the Great after less than a decade on the throne. Having long employed old Bach's son Carl--a more celebrated composer at the time--Frederick summoned the father from Leipzig and challenged him, with an offhanded cruelty, to a public compositional puzzle designed to humiliate the great wizard of the waning art of counterpoint.Gaines is a pleasant guide through the incestuous patchwork monarchies of middle Europe, with a breezy tone fitting for a former editor ofPeople. (\"The Hohenzollerns were a funny bunch,\" he writes at one point.) But he is also a passionately learned student of the intricacies of the era's musical theories and the secret languages of its coded compositions. (One is thankful that he and his publisher resisted calling the bookThe Bach Code.) Gaines leads up to his pivotal encounter with a double biography of his two principals, told in alternating chapters. Bach's mostly homebound life, which left few documents for historians, is often no match for the grotesque dramas of Frederick's parallel story, which climaxes when his father the king forces Frederick to witness the execution of his best friend (and perhaps lover). The weight that keeps the two stories in balance is the genius of Bach's work, particularly the masterfulMusical Offeringthat he composes in response to the king's challenge. The encounter itself may not bear the full burden that Gaines wants to give it, as a clash between two epochal worldviews, the faith of the Reformation versus the rationalism of the Enlightenment, but the two life stories he so vividly describes make the journey there more than worthwhile.--Tom Nissley","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Evening in the Palace of Reason'?","response":"In his lively history,Evening in the Palace of Reason, James R.

{"title":"The Lord of the Rings","content":"A Christian can almost be forgiven for not reading the Bible, but there's no salvation for a fantasy fan who hasn't read the gospel of the genre, J.R.R. Tolkien's definitive three-book epic, the Lord of the Rings (encompassingThe Fellowship of the Ring,The Two Towers, andThe Return of the King), and its charming precursor,The Hobbit. That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another.Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Lord of the Rings'?","response":"A Christian can almost be forgiven for not reading the Bible, but there's no salvation for a fantasy fan who hasn't read the gospel of the genre, J.R.R.

{"title":"Violent Ward","content":"Deighton's latest, an enjoyable departure from his tales of British espionage ( City of Gold , etc.), introduces a protagonist with definite series potential. Harried L.A. lawyer Mickey Murphy is plagued by a slew of eccentrics who fully bear out the book's epigraph: \"If America is a lunatic asylum then California is the Violent Ward.\" Among them are an ex-wife who tries to get more alimony by perching on the ledge outside his office, a slightly over-the-hill actor in search of a handgun, a Robert Maxwell clone called Sir Jeremy Westbridge and a Trump-like entrepreneur named Zach Petrovich, who owns Murphy's law firm and is married to his high school sweetheart. Their maneuverings spark a complicated plot whose many ramifications include a charitable organization that doubles as a clearinghouse for those seeking to fake their own deaths and the set-up of a tax-free Peruvian corporation through the use of bearer shares, but Murphy keeps all the craziness in perspective with a first-person narration that unfolds as a series of quiet, subtle surprises. Told in perfect Dashiell Hammett style, with the clues all noted but never underlined, this novel respects the reader's intelligence and almost begs for a rereading just to savor how skillfully Deighton has woven everything together.

Their maneuverings spark a complicated plot whose many ramifications include a charitable organization that doubles as a clearinghouse for those seeking to fake their own deaths and the set-up of a tax-free Peruvian corporation through the use of bearer shares, but Murphy keeps all the craziness in perspective with a first-person narration that unfolds as a series of quiet, subtle surprises. Told in perfect Dashiell Hammett style, with the clues all noted but never underlined, this novel respects the reader's intelligence and almost begs for a rereading just to savor how skillfully Deighton has woven everything together.

{"title":"Problem at Pollensa Bay","content":"Dame Agatha Christie's prolific output of novels, short stories, and plays have sold more than 400 million copies and have been translated into 103 languages. Only the Bible and works by Shakespeare have outdistanced her. Problems at Pollensa Bay & Other Stories provides a delightful addition to this vast body of writing by \"the mistress of mystery.\" Though these eight stories are not new, several are less well known, and this audiobook represents an exciting renewal of one of the world's most popular authors. \"The Harlequin Tea Set,\" thought to be Dame Agatha's last short story, is a tale of mistaken identity and features Mr. Saterthwaite and Harley Quin, who also appear together in \"The Love Detectives,\" a little-known story about a messy love triangle. Mr. Parker Pyne, Christie's goverment statistician turned detective, is called upon to save a love-struck young man in the title story. Also included is a mystery involving the eccentric and slightly pompous Hercule Poirot. The audiobook is narrated by Jonathan Cecil, whose superb vocal adaptations greatly enhance Dame Agatha's work. This is an excellent production, highly entertaining, and a most worthwhile purchase for any library.?Gretchen Browne, Rockville Centre P.L.,Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'Problem at Pollensa Bay'?","response":"Dame Agatha Christie's prolific output of novels, short stories, and plays have sold more than 400 million copies and have been translated into 103 languages.

{"title":"The Illustrated Man (Voyager Classics)","content":"ThatThe Illustrated Manhas remained in print since being  published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first wasDark Carnival, later reworked intoThe October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now.--Stanley Wiater--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","prompt":"Qual \u00e9 a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto chamado 'The Illustrated Man (Voyager Classics)'?","response":"ThatThe Illustrated Manhas remained in print since being  published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work.

{"title":"Potatoes: A Country Garden Cookbook","content":"Waldrone ( Cold Spaghetti at Midnight ) here finds redeeming value in a humble thing, traipsing with the potato through culinary Mexico, France, Italy, Hungary, the Middle East and various quarters of North America. As glimpsed through the fine nostalgic mist of Jones's camera, the root swells a Mediterranean fish stew; stuffs golden fowl or green chilies; or lies au naturel , pending baking or roasting. Among the most appealing recipes are the simplest: in roasted balsamic potatoes and onions, recommended as an accompaniment to red meats, the contenders are oven-roasted first in olive oil and then in seasoned balsamic vinegar; in rosemary potato skewers, potato chunks are boiled, dredged in herbs and spices, and grilled on charcoal. But if the potato lends itself to these visceral pleasures, it can also sneak into upper-crust tarts without suffering. (And even into hummus--where, one suspects, it may languish.) Waldron, trained at La Varenne, offers appetizers, side dishes and main courses in her brief book, a new entry in Collins's attractive Country Garden Cookbook series, and even offers advice to the amateur grower--but omits desserts, where potatoes can give depth and moist substance, if not pungence, to tortes.
